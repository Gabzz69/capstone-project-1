        <h2>The things i love doing in my free time are:</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3><li>Playing Piano</li></h3>
            Playing the piano appeals to me because it offers a deep way of expressing myself. Every piece I play tells a story, and through the sound of the piano, I can convey emotions that words sometimes fail to capture.</br> It's a calming yet creative way to let my soul speak.</br>

            <h3><li>Soccer</li></h3>
            Soccer brings me energy and a sense of teamwork. I enjoy the dynamic nature of the game, the idea of healthy competition, and the joy of being part of a group where everyone contributes. It also helps me stay</br> active and disconnect from everyday routines.</br>

            <h3><li>Photography</li></h3>
            Photography attracts me because it teaches me to see the world differently — with greater attention to detail. I love capturing moments, expressions, landscapes, or light that might otherwise go unnoticed.</br> It’s an art form that gives me both visual and emotional satisfaction.</br>

            <h3><li>Computers</li></h3>
            Computers fascinate me through their complexity and logic. I enjoy learning how things work behind the screen, exploring, creating, or solving problems. It’s a field that intellectually challenges me and constantly</br> motivates me to grow.</br>

            <h3><li>Drawing</li></h3>
            Drawing, which I loved as a child, was a gateway to my imagination. I enjoyed giving shape to my thoughts and fantasies on paper, inventing characters or expressing what I felt. It was a peaceful and colorful</br> activity that helped nurture my creativity from an early age.</br>
